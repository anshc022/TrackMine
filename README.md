# TrackMine: Revolutionizing Coal Sector Project Management

## Overview

TrackMine is a comprehensive web-based application designed to transform the monitoring and management of Science & Technology (S&T) and Research & Development (R&D) projects in the coal sector. Developed by Team TRISHUL for the Smart India Hackathon 2024, this innovative solution addresses the challenges faced by the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI) in effectively tracking and reporting on project progress.

## Key Features

1. **Centralized Project Management**: A unified platform for managing all S&T/R&D projects, enabling real-time tracking and monitoring.
2. **Automated Reporting**: Dynamic dashboards and reports provide stakeholders with instant insights into project performance.
3. **AI-Powered Analytics**: Predictive analytics and recommendations using advanced machine learning techniques.
4. **Secure Access Control**: Role-based permissions and data encryption ensure the confidentiality of project information.
5. **Offline Functionality**: Allows users to access and update project data even without internet connectivity.
6. **Mobile Accessibility**: Optimized for seamless project management on-the-go.
7. **Enhanced Communication**: Facilitates real-time collaboration and information exchange among team members and stakeholders.

## Technical Approach

- **Frontend**: React Native for cross-platform compatibility
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for robust server-side operations
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible and scalable data storage
- **AI Integration**: PyTorch for advanced data analysis and predictive algorithms
- **Security**: Multi-layered approach including authentication and encryption
- **Natural Language Processing**: LLAMA 2 for intelligent user interactions

## Benefits

- Improved project visibility and control
- Increased operational efficiency through automation
- Enhanced decision-making with real-time data and AI insights
- Reduced errors and improved data accuracy
- Potential for significant cost and time savings
